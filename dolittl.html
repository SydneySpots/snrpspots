    	<p>
    	As a partner with <a href = "http://www.leporidaemedia.com">Leporidae Media</a>, Zoe and I came up with the general idea of harnessing a muse. Being a bit more of the hippy, feel-the-energy sort, I helped introduce her to her own muse. Not nessicarilly in the traditional, "This is what inspires me," but more as a manifestation of one's creative energy. Mine is a three-tailed kitsune named Rain. It's my creative energy personified, helping me to talk to it, interact with it, work with it to create.
    	<br />
    	<br />
    	So we got to thinking. If I could do that for her, why not do it for everyone?
    	<br />
    	<br />
    	Enter Dolittl. Ever evolving, we've pitched it almost as Fitocracy meets DeviantArt. The idea is, we pair users with a initial 'muse' of their own and they tell Dolittl what kind of things they want to do, be it writing, music making, coding, anything! With each muse, they personally guide you through exercises in their own voices to help nudge the user to create something. Not nessicarily the next EDM smash hit, or InstaFaceTwitter, but something to show that "Hey! I am creative. I can create. It's not out of the realm of possibility."
    	<br />
    	<br />
    	Aside from being a co-founder, my role was to come up with the initial gamut of muses that the users would interact with through e-mails and other media. I also am in charge of coming up with the general tracks/exercises for specific tracks (I.E. A writer would start by creating a occupation for the muse they work with. A musician might bounce song melodies off their muse). We're currently in the process of figuring out the next steps to bring it into a beta stage.
